My laptop's drive was able to burn at 8x and it was a little better, but still had issues. Modern Blu-Ray burners barely burn CDs at all, and mostly as an afterthought at high speeds. Needless to say, older systems like a SegaCD, Saturn I have my parents old pioneer pd-m453 6 pack cd player. When I use a normal cd, it plays fine. However, when I burn music to a cd, no matter what format I use ( it still burns it to the cd as cda) it turns out with heavy distortion, especially with bass in the songs. The cd sounds fine on my computer when I play it through my disk drive. Any suggestions on how to make my burned cds sound fine on the cd player.
