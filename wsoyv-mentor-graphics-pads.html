                            <p> Hi all, I have a really exciting project on my hands and a key part of that project is making a passive 6-way (one 2 followed by a 3 on each branch) power splitter for GPS signals. Now I know I can buy off-the-shelf splitter ICs (MiniCircuits SEPS-8-272+) but I want to make the splitter myself and tick that box on my bucket list. What CAD tool would you suggest I use? I would like to be able to simulate my splitter or at least get the software to suggest track widths, lengths etc. based 
The company I'm at has a license for the Mentor Graphics PADS programs for PCB logic and layout, but they seem super clunky and poorly designed to me. Does anyone have any advice for more commonly used/better supported alternatives out there? I'm not looking for freeware, rather, something robust that could be used for commercial purposes. Thanks for your advice. Hi, I use Mentor Graphics Pads at work. It supports exporting a 3D model of the PCB in IDF format. IDF seem to be quite perfect from reading all information about it, but I cant find any program for opening it except Solidworks. Am i wrong? We use Rhinoceros for simple modeling, and i want to use it to see if my PCB will fit the mechanics. Simple stuff, but buying Solidworks just to convert a format is out of the picture. A simple IDF -> STEP converter would be quite nice. Any suggestions.

Hi Reddit, I'm looking for some feedback on my resume. The names and locations have been changed to protect the innocent, but everything else is true. Could you please look it over and give me your feedback? If you saw this resume would you give me a call back? I've spent the last 4 years as board level mixed analog/digital designer doing design and test. I really enjoy embedded design, but I've had very limited opportunities to do that with my current employer. I'm looking to change that. Hi, so I was looking at a potential job opportunity, and under preferred experience, DxDesigner and PADS are listed. Is there any way I can get experience with these (or similar) tools without buying them? I have worked with a fairly wide variety of CAD tools, so I'm sure I'll have no problem working with them, but I would like to go into the interview with more than that to say about it.

# MAME 0.204 (https://www.mamedev.org/?p=463) After a busy four weeks, we’re ready to present the hotly-anticipated MAME 0.204 release. The most exciting stuff this month is definitely on the computer emulation side. We’ve added dozens of working cartridges to the BBC ROM software list, and ROMs required by expansion devices are handled more elegantly. Our HP9000/300 series emulation just keeps getting better: it’s now possible to install and use HP-UX 9, with X11 and the Vue desktop enviro.

The following is a long review/critique of Assassin's Creed 2. This piece is written with the assumption you've fully played AC2 and are familiar with AC1, Bro, Rev, 3, Rogue and Origins. This piece will look at the game's story, mechanics and content in detail. I won't do a play by play of the story, instead putting the story and the gameplay in their own sections, analyzing the main points as needed.

The big difference is the support and guidance you'll receive as a student of the paid course. You'll have a mentor to learn iOS app development fast and efficiently. On YouTube, many questions go unanswered simply because our time is prioritized for students of the paid courses. In addition to the support you'll receive, the full course. Tell us a little about yourself. I usually say “Oh, I hate talking about myself” when prompted with this question, but I won’t do that, even though I kinda just did. Screw your rules, me. Kinda.

I wish to have something as portable as possible that is mostly used as a desktop replacement, but can be brought with me on occasion to do some programming with. I want to be able to use full CAD design software on it seamlessly and be able to play most games at decent FPS on medium settings.

Apologies if I am in the wrong place. I figured that if I was, someone here would be able to direct me somewhere better. I seem to be in a 1 year cycle of getting a job, getting a pay rise, then losing it and dropping a huge amount. I am not sure what work I should be applying for, what training I should be looking into etc etc. My strongest suit is probably my people skills. I am great at talking to people.

At my internship this summer I've been using the PADS suite from Mentor Graphics to do schematic and PCB layout work. It gets the job done. That is it did until I learned how much we were paying for 1 license (the company I work at is small). That 1 license is hardware locked to a USB dongle. 2 to be precise. Now I HATE this software.
